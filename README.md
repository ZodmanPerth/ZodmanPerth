I've been a full-time Microsoft stack application developer since before the .NET Framework was born.
I have a passion for pixel-perfect UI layout, well-designed and functional customer experiences, data modelling, elegant code that is easy to extend and maintain, and elevating the quality of work in the developers around me.

I work on my own projects in my spare time.  If you read me [blog](https://www.redperegrine.net/) (or my Twitter/X feed) you'll find me
referring to [#zodproj](https://twitter.com/hashtag/zodproj?src=hashtag_click), which is how I categorise
these projects.
